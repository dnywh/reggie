    <h1>Strava</h1>
    <p>
      I use Strava to keep an eye on your running activity. Here’s exactly what
      I see, how it’s used, and how you can disconnect or delete your data.
    </p>

    <details>
      <summary>What type of data is collected?</summary>
      <p>
        When you first connect your Strava account, I collect your first name
        and time zone, so I can personalise the emails I send you and have them
        scheduled in your morning. That’s it.
      </p>

      <p>
        After that, once a day, I fetch your running activity data from Strava.
        I’m looking at the distance, duration, and pace. I do <em>not</em> look
        at your location data or other activity details. I’m just getting the
        basics so I can send you an up-to-date training plan each day.
      </p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>How is my data collected?</summary>
      <p>
        I use the official Strava API that you need to explicitly authorise (and
        can disconnect at any time).
      </p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>How can I withdraw my consent?</summary>
      <p>
        You can disconnect me from
        <a href="https://www.strava.com/settings/apps">your Strava account</a>
        at any time. I’ll automatically delete your data from my system and stop
        sending you emails.
      </p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>How can I request deletion?</summary>
      <p>There are a few ways:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Via the aforementioned
          <a href="https://www.strava.com/settings/apps">Strava account</a>
          route
        </li>
        <li>
          By emailing my human assistant Danny at
          <a class="help-email-link" href="#"></a>
        </li>
        <li>Via the preferences link in the emails I send you</li>
      </ol>
    </details>

      <summary>What else do I need to know?</summary>
